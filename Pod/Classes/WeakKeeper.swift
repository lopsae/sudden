/// WeakKeeper can be used to keep a reference to objects that are kept only
/// as weak references, and thus would be lost after leaving the context in
/// which these where created. The use case is target-action objects or
/// delegates created inline, for which there is no other reference other that
/// the target or delegate property, commonly a weak reference.
/// 
/// WeakKeeper can be instructed to clean all keepsakes for which their weak
/// references have expired, leaving the keepsake free to be disposed.
